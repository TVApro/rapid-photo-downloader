Rapid Photo Downloader
======================

Rapid Photo Downloader imports photos and videos from cameras, phones,
memory cards  and other devices at high speed. It can be configured to
rename photos and videos with meaningful filenames you specify. It can back
up photos and videos as they are downloaded.

Rapid Photo Downloader can download from and back up to multiple devices
simultaneously. Unique to Rapid Photo Downloader is its timeline feature,
allowing you to group photos and videos based on how much time elapsed
between consecutive shots. You can use this to quickly identify photos and
videos taken at different periods in a single day or over consecutive days.

Written by a photographer for professional and amateur photographers, Rapid
Photo Downloader is easy to configure and use. Program preferences are
configured without the need for complicated codes. Common tasks can be
automated, such as unmounting a memory card when the download is complete.
