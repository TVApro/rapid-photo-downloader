Rapid Photo Downloader is written by a photographer for professional and amateur
photographers. Released under the GNU GPL license, it is designed for use on the
Linux Desktop. It can download photos from multiple cameras, memory cards, and
Portable Storage Devices simultaneously. It provides many options for subfolder
creation, image renaming and backup.

It can download images directly from only from those cameras supported by
gphoto2, and only on recent Linux distributions (those that contain GIO).
