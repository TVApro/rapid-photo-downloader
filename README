Rapid Photo Downloader is written by a photographer for professional and amateur
photographers. Released under the GNU GPL license, it is designed for use on the
GNOME 2 Desktop. It can download photos from multiple memory cards and Portable
Storage Devices simultaneously. It provides a variety of options for sub-folder
creation, image renaming and backup.

This software is still being developed.  Many but not all features 
work.

It does not download images directly from a camera unless the camera is 
recognized as an external drive.  

Rapid Photo Downloader depends on the following software:

- GNOME 2.18
- GTK+ 2.10
- Python 2.5
- pygtk 2.10
- python-gconf 2.18
- python-glade2 2.10 
- gnome-python 2.10
- libexiv2 0.15
- pyexiv2 0.12

Please feel welcome to contribute anything to help make this project a success: 
feature suggestions, bug reports, code, artwork, translations, and documentation
are all needed!

Installation
============

To run Rapid Photo Downloader you will need all the software mentioned above. To
start from a fairly basic system, I suggest the following:

1. Install the required gnome packages from your linux distribution's package 
   repositories.  On a recent linux distribution, expect all to be available for
   easy download and installation.  If you already use gnome, most of the 
   packages will already be installed.  Do confirm that python-gconf, 
   python-glade2, and gnome-python are installed, because they
   may not be quite so common in a base system.
    
2. Install pyexiv2.  You can probably do that using your distributions's package 
   repositories. But if not, there are instructions here: 
   
   http://tilloy.net/dev/pyexiv2/developers.htm
   
3. Install this application from the tarball. You probably need to be the 
   super user (root) to be able to do this:

   sudo python setup.py install

Running the program
===================
   
Start the program by running:

rapid-photo-downloader

from the command line, or manually setup a panel launcher using an icon supplied in
the tarball.
