Rapid Photo Downloader is a photo downloader written by a photographer for
professional and amateur photographers. Released under the GNU GPL license, it 
is designed for use on the GNOME 2 Desktop. It can download photos from multiple
memory cards and Portable Storage Devices simultaneously. It provides a variety 
of options for sub-folder creation, image renaming and backup.

This software is still being developed.  Many but not all features 
work.

It does not download images directly from a camera, but it may do in a future
release.  This capability depends on libgphoto2.  This program is written in
python, and the python bindings for libgphoto2 are still in alpha status.

Rapid Photo Downloader depends on the following software:

- GNOME 2.18
- GTK+ 2.10
- Python 2.5
- pygtk 2.10
- python-gconf 2.18
- python-glade2 2.10 
- gnome-python 2.10
- libexiv2 0.15
- pyexiv2 0.12
- bazaar (to download this code and pyexiv2!)

Please feel welcome to contribute anything to help make this project a success: 
feature suggestions, bug reports, code, artwork, translations, and documentation
are all needed!

Installation
============

To run Rapid Photo Downloader you will need all the software mentioned above. To
start from a fairly basic system, I suggest the following:

1. Install as much as you can from your linux distribution's package 
   repositories.  On a recent linux distribution, expect all to be available for
   easy download and installation.  If you already use gnome, most of the 
   packages will already be installed.  Do confirm that python-gconf, 
   python-glade2, and gnome-python are installed, because they
   may not be quite so common in a base system.
    
2. Install pyexiv2.  You can probably do that your distributions's package 
   repositories. But if not, there are instructions here: 
   
   http://tilloy.net/dev/pyexiv2/developers.htm
   
   In essence, do this -
   
   Install these packages (and any packages they depend on, which could be quite
   a few):
   
   * libboost-python-dev
   * libexiv2-dev
   * scons
   * bzr (not to be confused with the package bazaar, which is not relevant to 
     our needs!)
   * g++

   Then this:
   
   * create a new directory somewhere, and change into it
   * execute the follwing commands:
     # bzr branch http://tilloy.net/branches/pyexiv2
     # cd pyexiv2
     # scons
     # sudo scons install

3. Install this application somewhere in your home directory.  What you need to
   do is download it, rename its download directory, and start using it
   
   Execute the following commands:
    # bzr branch http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~dlynch3/rapid/trunk
    # mv trunk rapid 
    # cd rapid
    # ./rapid.py
    
   The last step runs the program. Whenever you need to run it, execute the last
   step from within the download directory ;-)

Known Bugs
==========

* Cannot unmount the media while the application is running. I'd love to get 
  this working.  I'm open to suggestions!
  Update: this may have been fixed upstream in pygtk
* Select all and deselect all do nothing
* Checkbutton on each image device does nothing
* Checks to see if image already exists are not thread safe, and may cause 
  images to be overwritten if downloading in parallel (so make sure your 
  filenames are going to be unique!)
* Closing log window with window manager 'x' instead of 'close' button not yet
  supported
* Backup feature temporarily disabled
* Auto-detection of Portable Storage Devices needs to be written
* And no doubt many many more bugs.....
