Rapid Photo Downloader is written by a photographer for professional and amateur
photographers. Released under the GNU GPL license, it is designed for use on the
Linux Desktop. It can download photos from multiple cameras, memory cards, and
Portable Storage Devices simultaneously. It provides many options for subfolder
creation, image renaming and backup.

It can download images directly from only from those cameras supported by
libgphoto2, and only on recent Linux distributions (those that contain gvfs).
This support is experimental. Some cameras do not work. If you cannot browse the 
camera's contents in a file manager (e.g. Nautilus), the camera download will
not work until the gvfs support is improved.

Cameras that do not work as at May 2009 include the Canon 20D and 300D.

Known Bugs
==========

* Closing log window with window manager 'x' instead of 'close' button not yet
  supported

* When metadata is corrupt (for example a corrupt camera model entry), and it is
  used as part of image renaming or subfolder name generation, the filename 
  could contain badly encoded or garbage values. These images should not be
  downloaded at all.
