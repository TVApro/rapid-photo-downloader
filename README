Rapid Photo Downloader is a photo downloader written by a photographer for
professional and amateur photographers. Released under the GNU GPL license, it 
is designed for use on the GNOME 2 Desktop. It can download photos from multiple
memory cards and Portable Storage Devices simultaneously. It provides a variety 
of options for sub-folder creation, image renaming and backup.

This software is still being developed.  Many but not all features 
work.

It does not download images directly from a camera, but it may do in a future
release.  This capability depends on libgphoto2.  This program is written in
python, and the python bindings for libgphoto2 are still in alpha status.

Rapid Photo Downloader depends on the following software:

- GNOME 2.18
- GTK+ 2.10
- Python 2.5
- pygtk 2.10
- python-gconf 2.18
- python-glade2 2.10 
- gnome-python 2.10
- libexiv2 0.15
- pyexiv2 0.12

Please feel welcome to contribute anything to help make this project a success: 
feature suggestions, bug reports, code, artwork, translations, and documentation
are all needed!

Installation
============

To run Rapid Photo Downloader you will need all the software mentioned above. To
start from a fairly basic system, I suggest the following:

1. Install the required gnome packages from your linux distribution's package 
   repositories.  On a recent linux distribution, expect all to be available for
   easy download and installation.  If you already use gnome, most of the 
   packages will already be installed.  Do confirm that python-gconf, 
   python-glade2, and gnome-python are installed, because they
   may not be quite so common in a base system.
    
2. Install pyexiv2.  You can probably do that using your distributions's package 
   repositories. But if not, there are instructions here:

3. Install this application from the tarball

   python setup.py install
   
Start the program by running rapid-photo-downloader from the command line, or 
manually setup a panel launcher using an icon supplied in the tarball.

Known Bugs
==========

* Cannot unmount the media while the application is running. I'd love to get 
  this working.  I'm open to suggestions!
* Select all and deselect all do nothing
* Checkbutton on each image device does nothing
* Checks to see if image already exists are not thread safe, and may cause 
  images to be overwritten if downloading in parallel (so make sure your 
  filenames are going to be unique!)
* Closing log window with window manager 'x' instead of 'close' button not yet
  supported
* Backup feature temporarily disabled
* Auto-detection of Portable Storage Devices needs to be written
