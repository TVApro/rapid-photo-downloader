      Rapid Photo Downloader imports photos and videos from cameras, phones,
      memory cards and other devices at high speed. It can be configured to
      rename photos and videos with meaningful filenames you specify. It can
      back up photos and videos as they are downloaded. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Rapid Photo Downloader can download from and back up to multiple devices
      simultaneously. Unique to Rapid Photo Downloader is its timeline feature,
      allowing you to group photos and videos based on how much time elapsed
      between consecutive shots. You can use this to quickly identify photos
      and videos taken at different periods in a single day or over consecutive
      days.

      Written by a photographer for professional and amateur photographers, 
      Rapid Photo Downloader is easy to configure and use. Program preferences
      are configured without the need for complicated codes. Common tasks can be
      automated, such as unmounting a memory card when the download is complete.
