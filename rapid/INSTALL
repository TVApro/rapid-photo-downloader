Rapid Photo Downloader requires the following software:

* Python >= 3.4
* PyQt >= 5.4
* Python3-zmq
* Python3-gphoto2 >= 1.2.0
* Python3-psutil
* Python3-scandir
* Python3-sortedcontainers
* Python3-xdg
* Python3-arrow
* Python3-dateutil
* Qt 5 Image Formats module
* Python 3 bindings for gobject-introspection libraries
* GObject-based wrapper around the Exiv2 library introspection data
* GObject based library to access udisks2 introspection data
* Libgudev-1.0 introspection data
* GObject-based wrapper library for libudev
* ExifTool

To run Rapid Photo Downloader you will need all the software mentioned above.

On a distribution like Ubuntu, you can install dependencies like this:

sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt5 python3-zmq python3-psutil python3-xdg 
python3-arrow python3-dateutil qt5-image-formats-plugins gir1.2-gudev
gir1.2-udisks gir1.2-gexiv2 libimage-exiftool-perl

The following three components may not be packaged in your Linux distribution.
You can install them by following the instructions outlined here:
* https://github.com/jim-easterbrook/python-gphoto2

On Ubuntu, to install python-gphoto2 you can install it by running these
commands:

sudo apt-get install libgphoto2-dev python3-pip
sudo apt-get install install -v --system gphoto2

Please note, if you're using a system with more than one version of python 3
(such as Ubuntu 15.10), when installing packages using pip I suggest targetting
the default version of python 3, not whatever pip3 happens to default to. In 
Ubuntu 15.10, pip3 defaults to python3.5. To run pip3 with python 3.4, run this
instead:

sudo python3.4 -m pip install -v --system gphoto2

The version of Python's "sorted containers" is quite old in Ubuntu. To install
a more recent version for your user (and not system wide), run:

Sorted containers is here:
* http://grantjenks.com/docs/sortedcontainers/

You can install it with:

sudo pip3 install sortedcontainers

or if necessary, as noted above:
sudo python3.4 -m pip install -v sortedcontainers


Python 3.5 comes with scandir. To install it in Python 3.4, visit:
